## AMI's

- These are `Amazon Machine Images` -- snapshots of a virtual machine in a certain state


## Packer

- Install `Packer` onto a machine

- Packer will create AMI's for us on some cloud service
    - It will use a base AMI and will use a provisioning tool (like Ansible) to put it in a desired state
    - Once the instance has been created and provisioned, it will create an AMI of that instance and store it in the list of AMI's
    - In AWS, this is achieved by spinning up a temporary EC2 instance, provisioning it, taking an AMI of it and finally terminating the instance

- Iteration 1:
```json
{
  "variables": {
    "aws_access_key": "",
    "aws_secret_key": ""
  },
  "builders": [{
      "type": "amazon-ebs",
      "access_key": "{{user `aws_access_key`}}",
      "secret_key": "{{user `aws_secret_key`}}",
      "region": "eu-west-1",
      "source_ami_filter": {
        "filters": {
          "virtualization-type": "hvm",
          "name": "ubuntu/images/*ubuntu-bionic-18.04-amd64-server-*",
          "root-device-type": "ebs"},
        "owners": ["099720109477"],
        "most_recent": true},

      "instance_type": "t2.micro",
      "ssh_username": "ubuntu",
      "ami_name": "packer-example {{timestamp}}"
    }]
}
```

- We now need to ensure that Packer can read the AWS access and secret keys. Since we do not want these keys to be available publicly, a quick fix is to include them within our environment variables
    - We can achieve this through several ways but a quick one is to just put them inside `.bashrc` and run it so it takes effect
    - This ensures that the keys will always be available as environment variables

- Iteration 2:
```json
{
////// NEW CODE
// We can reference environment variables in json through the env keyword
// The referencing is identical to Jinja2, i.e. the double curly braces
  "variables": {
    "aws_access_key": "{{env `AWS_ACCESS_KEY`}}",
    "aws_secret_key": "{{env `AWS_SECRET_KEY`}}"
  },
//

  "builders": [{
      "type": "amazon-ebs",
      "access_key": "{{user `aws_access_key`}}",
      "secret_key": "{{user `aws_secret_key`}}",
      "region": "eu-west-1",
      "source_ami_filter": {
        "filters": {
          "virtualization-type": "hvm",
          "name": "ubuntu/images/*ubuntu-bionic-18.04-amd64-server-*",
          "root-device-type": "ebs"
        },
        "owners": ["099720109477"],
        "most_recent": true
      },
      "instance_type": "t2.micro",
      "ssh_username": "ubuntu",
      "ami_name": "eng74-jared-packer-ami-{{timestamp}}"
    }],
}
```

- As can be seen, this AMI doesn't really change anything -- it is an identical copy to the `bionic64` one we normally use as we have not provisioned it with anything. We will need to add a `provision` section
    - We can provision the AMI using several tools such as bash scripts or Ansible
    - The following is an example of using Ansible

- Iteration 3:
```json
{
  "variables": {
    "aws_access_key": "{{env `AWS_ACCESS_KEY`}}",
    "aws_secret_key": "{{env `AWS_SECRET_KEY`}}"
  },
  "builders": [{
      "type": "amazon-ebs",
      "access_key": "{{user `aws_access_key`}}",
      "secret_key": "{{user `aws_secret_key`}}",
      "region": "eu-west-1",
      "source_ami_filter": {
        "filters": {
          "virtualization-type": "hvm",
          "name": "ubuntu/images/*ubuntu-bionic-18.04-amd64-server-*",
          "root-device-type": "ebs"
        },
        "owners": ["099720109477"],
        "most_recent": true
      },
      "instance_type": "t2.micro",
      "ssh_username": "ubuntu",
      "ami_name": "eng74-jared-packer-ami-{{timestamp}}"
    }],

////// NEW CODE

}
```

      export DB_HOST={{ database_priv_ip }}
      pm2 reload app.js --update-env
    args:
      chdir: /home/ubuntu/app
```

- **Notes:**
    1. To ensure the playbook functions as intended, make note of the `hosts` declaration, if one specifies a `connection: local` within the playbook then the playbook will run on the actual ansible controller NOT on the temporary instance packer creates

- Now that's good, but when we create an instance out of the image the app doesn't necessarily run. Some system states aren't kept so one needs to find a way to fix it:
